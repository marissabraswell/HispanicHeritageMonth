				Since April 2022, more than 116,000 migrants have come to New York City. The city has been consistently taking these migrants but as of the last month, this crisis has reached a fever pitch with many feeling like these migrants are a burden on the city. Most of these immigrants are coming from Latin America and claiming asylum because of economic and political turmoil in their home countries. For example, the US has taken 545,000 immigrants from Venueula alone due the countries recent economic collapse. 
				Despite the recent narrative of immigrants being a burden, nearly 40% of New York City residents are foreign-born. They contribute to the economy and even own half of all small businesses in the city. In honor of Hispanic Heritage Month, we’d like to highlight 3 Latinx-Immigrant Owned Small Businesses.

		<h3>Latinx people make up 28% of New York City and immigrants own 50% of all small businesses in this city, these 3 businesses are a few of thousands.
